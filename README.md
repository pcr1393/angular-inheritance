# AngularInheritance

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.1.
1) This project was designed to give a basic understanding of how inheritance works in Angular
2) It also does a simple form validation using Reactive forms and how inheritance can be clubbed with Reactive forms to achieve the Validation of the form fields.
3) It also stresses upon the fact on how inheritance avoids writing duplicate code across multiple angular components.
